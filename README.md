Presently in sports, we see the use of technology in resolving doubtful decisions. These decisions may go onto have a defining impact in the context of the match. In cricket which is trying to apply technology for maintining the fairness of the game, yet retain the human involvement there exists certain issues. 
a) The NO-Balls are still decided meanually by the umpires. The law says that when the foot touches the ground "some" part of the boot has to remain behind the line. There are cases when the boot remains on the line and it gets really difficult to judge the fairness of the delivery. Similar is the case for stumpings whe a manual intervention is done to decide if the foot is dragged by the batsman before the bail is dislodged.

b) For caught-behind cases, the use of Snicko-meter stumbles when the bat hits the pad and simultaneously the ball passes the bat showing a vibration in the Snicko-meter graph. Mostly it is assumed that there is an edge and the batsman is given out which is unfair.

a) In order to resolve Problem (a), for controversial foot landing of the bowlers, the "Spider-Cam" or a Drone acn be used to capture the footlanding of the bowler. If thefoot is on the line and no part of it is behind the crease, the decision has to be in favour of the batsman. This will alleviate the manual interevntion while influencing suchkind of decisions. Similar effort can be made for stumpings.

b) For Problem (b) by using probablistic modelling for a ball bowled, we can predict its direction till the time its hits the bat of the batsman. Now, if the ball doesn,t hit the bat, the ball will follow a certain trajectory. However even if there is slightest of knicks, there will be a deviation. If there is difference in trajectory of the ball between no-hit and "probable" hit cases, the there must be a deflection off the bat. This can solve the case of those cases where there is no edge but thebat hits the pad and the batsman remains not out.
